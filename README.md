This project includes several prototyped features attempting to improve the speed of reading a large matrix of doubles from disk.

NOTE: the ArrayStreamReader.h/cpp class is not functional and is built into the readFromDisk.cpp driver. This class was only intended
for the purpose of comparing the other methods to the normal method of reading a file through getline()
